    <h1>Saigon Noodle Salad</h1>
    <img src="../images/saigon salad.jpg" alt="saigon noodle salad">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Vietnamese-style noodle salad is my 'too hot to cook' staple. It is bursting with flavor and makes great use of leftover grilled meat or shrimp.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup water, or more to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lime juice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk water, lime juice, fish sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and Sriracha together in a bowl until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a full boil; remove from heat and soak rice noodles in the hot water for 1 minute. Stir to separate the noodles and continue soaking until the noodles are tender, about 3 minutes more. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water until cooled. Shake noodles in colander to drain as much water as possible.</li>
        <li>Mix noodles, cabbage, carrots, shrimp, bean sprouts, cucumber slices, green onions, mint, cilantro, and basil together in a large bowl. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Top with chopped peanuts.</li>
    </ol>
